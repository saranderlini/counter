# counter
This project is part of Start-2-Impact second Module on JavaScript Basics. The goal is to create a counter that increases or decreases by one the rolling of numbers. 
I created four options for changing the result displayed on the counter: click on the '+' and '-' buttons or use the up/right and down/left keys on the keypad. Moreover, I added both the option of resetting the counter to zero (by either pressing the related button or the 'r' letter on the keyword), and a button that takes the user to a high number.
The styling and scripting sources are documented inside the asset folder. In particular, JS asset comprises of three different files: the former for the DOM manipulation, a second for the sections' advancement, and the latter concerns the counter implementation.
This is my third attempt, as my first one had not met all the criteria (my bad, I had not fully got the picture), and the second one had rooom for improvement.
It's been very valuable receiving feedbacks - many of the changes that I made, especially lately, had lots to do with the readability and the good practices. Honestly, had I not embarked on this course, it would have taken me much longer to actually figure out these important and meaningful aspecrs.
So, again, thank you for your contribution.
Thank you, I hope you will enjoy counting one-by-one :D Cheers, Sara
