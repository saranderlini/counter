# counter
This project is part of Start-2-Impact second Module on JavaScript Basics. The goal is to create a counter that increases or decreases by one the rolling of numbers. 
I created four options for changing the result displayed on the counter: click on the '+' and '-' buttons or use the up/right and down/left keys on the keypad. Moreover, I added both the option of resetting the counter to zero (by either pressing the related button or the 'r' letter on the keyword), and a button that takes the user to a high number.
The styling and scripting sources are documented inside the asset folder. In particular, JS asset comprises of three different files: the former for the DOM manipulation, a second for the sections' advancement, and the latter concerns the counter implementation.
This is my second attempt, as my first one had not met all the criteria (my bad, I had not fully got the picture).
Thanks to the precious advices received on the first submission of the current project, I tried to improve the code and the scripts.
I deeply thank you, tutors; see the value of having the chance of receiving feedbacks and support.
So thank you, I hope you will enjoy counting one-by-one :D Cheers, Sara
