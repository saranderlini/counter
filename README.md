# counter
This project is part of Start-2-Impact second Module on JavaScript Basics. The goal is to create a counter that increases or decreases by one the rolling of numbers. 
I created four options for changing the result displayed on the counter: click on the '+' and '-' buttons or use the up/right and down/left keys on the keypad. Moreover, I added both the option of resetting the counter to zero (by either pressing the related button or the 'r' letter on the keyword), and a button that takes the user to a high number.
Thanks to the precious advices received on the first submission of the current project, I tried to improve the code and the scripts.
I am thankful for S-2-I's tutors' time, patience and availability; I see the value of having the chance of receiving feedbacks and support.
So thank you, I hope you will enjoy counting one-by-one :D Cheers, Sara
